  <h2>
    Executive Summary
  </h2>
<p>
  This project will create a front-end for an MQTT broker with a database.  The front-end will allow users (IoT students) to create projects, add feeds, and make dashboards to view IoT generated data online.  The database will store a user's project which contains feeds and a dashboard.  THe database will also store received and transmitted data up to a preset limit.  The broker will send users a message if they send more than 30 messages per second but will not stop received traffic.
