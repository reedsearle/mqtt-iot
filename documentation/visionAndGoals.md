##  Vision

The IoT Bootcamp currently uses an MQTT broker from AdaFruit.  Although this works well for most students and projects, there are some issues that make creating a dedicated broker beneficial.  The free version of the AdaFruit broker is limited to 10 feeds (variables essentially), 5 dashboards, 30 writes/second, and only 30 days of data storage.  A less limited broker would allow students to keep dashboards and feeds for the entirety of the bootcamp. 

## Goals

The goals of this project are to:
Create a dedicated MQTT broker for the IoT bootcamp.
Design a better flow for dashboard creation.
Use gentle reminders for those students who trasnmit data too frequently instead of shutting down their feeds.
