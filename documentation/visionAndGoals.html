    Vision
  </h1>
  <p>
    The IoT Bootcamp currently uses an MQTT broker from AdaFruit.  Although this works well for most students and projects, there are some issues that make creating a dedicated broker beneficial.  The free version of the AdaFruit broker is limited to 10 feeds (variables essentially), 5 dashboards, 30 writes/second, and only 30 days of data storage.  A less limited broker would allow students to keep dashboards and feeds for the entirety of the bootcamp.

    Goals
  </h1>
  <p>
    The goals of this project are to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create a dedicated MQTT broker for the IoT bootcamp.
    </li>
    <li>
      Design a better flow for dashboard creation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use gentle reminders for those students who trasnmit data too frequently instead of shutting down their feeds.
    </li>
  </ul>
